# Drill1.6
----------

This is a deprecated version of Apache Drill with the max version being 1.6.   After this version (actually 1.8, not sure about 1.7) the config format allowed us to better coordinate the config files for changes of drill versions. 

Thus, for those, we use the new site config layout. This is kept in case someone needs to run Drill 1.6.  It's highly recommened to run the standard drill package.
